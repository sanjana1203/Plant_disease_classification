Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project implements an image-based plant disease classification system using a pretrained deep learning model. The system takes a plant leaf image as input and predicts the corresponding disease class, helping in early detection and prevention of crop damage.

Project Overview
Type: Image Classification
Domain: Agriculture / Computer Vision
Framework: TensorFlow (Keras)
Execution Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
The model leverages transfer learning to achieve accurate disease recognition without training a network from scratch.



Model Details

Uses a pretrained CNN model
Fine-tuned for plant disease classification
Accepts a single image as input
Outputs the predicted disease class with confidence




Technologies & Libraries Used

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
TensorFlow Datasets
NumPy
Matplotlib

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning and pretrained models can be effectively applied to real-world agricultural problems, enabling accurate and efficient plant disease detection.
