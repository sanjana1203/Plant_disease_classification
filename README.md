#  Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project implements an image-based plant disease classification system using a pretrained deep learning model.  
The system takes a plant leaf image as input and predicts the corresponding disease class, helping in early detection and prevention of crop damage.

##  Project Overview

- **Type:** Image Classification  
- **Domain:** Agriculture / Computer Vision  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow (Keras)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The model leverages **transfer learning** to achieve accurate disease recognition without training a network from scratch.

##  Model Details

- Uses a **pretrained CNN model**
- Fine-tuned for **plant disease classification**
- Accepts a **single image** as input
- Outputs the **predicted disease class with confidence**

---

##  Workflow

**Image Input → Preprocessing → Pretrained CNN → Prediction → Disease Output**

---

##  Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- TensorFlow Datasets  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

##  How to Run

1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload `plant.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
4. Provide a plant leaf image
5. View predicted disease output
